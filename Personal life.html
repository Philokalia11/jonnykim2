Jonathan Kim[1] was born in Los Angeles[2] in 1984.[3] Kim's parents emigrated from South Korea to the United States in the early 1980s;[2] his father scarcely completed a high-school education, the family opened a liquor store in South Los Angeles after arriving in the US, and his mother worked as a substitute elementary school teacher while raising Kim and his younger brother.[4] In a 2018 interview with Annals of Emergency Medicine, Kim described himself as "the epitome of that quiet kid who just lacked complete self-confidence."[5] In 2020, The Chosun Ilbo reported that an adolescent Kim had been the victim of domestic violence at the hands of his father; in February 2002, after threatening his family with a gun, Kim's father was shot to death in his attic by police.[6]</p>
